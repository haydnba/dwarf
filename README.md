## Invert Puppeteer

### Turn Puppeteer inside-out...


> The story is told of an automaton constructed in such a way that it could play
> a winning game of chess, answering each move of an opponent with a countermove.
> A puppet in Turkish attire and with a hookah in its mouth sat before a chessboard 
> placed on a large table. A system of mirrors created the illusion that this 
> table was transparent from all sides. Actually, a little hunchback who was an 
> expert chess player sat inside and guided the puppet’s hand by means of strings. 
> One can imagine a philosophical counterpart to this device. The puppet called 
> ‘historical materialism’ is to win all the time. It can easily be a match for 
> anyone if it enlists the services of theology, which today, as we know, is 
> wizened and has to keep out of sight.
